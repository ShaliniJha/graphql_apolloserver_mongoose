# apollo-server-tutorial
This repo contains the full code for the GraphQL server tutorial (Mongoose + REST).

Documentation and explanations can be found on [docs.apollostack.com](http://dev.apollodata.com/tools/apollo-server/index.html)

## How to use

In order for the MongoDB part of this example to work, you need to have MongoDB installed on your machine. All other required parts come with this package.

Restore the mongo dump

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

The server should now accept requests at http://localhost:8080/graphql
